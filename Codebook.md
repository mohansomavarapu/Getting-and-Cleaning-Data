The file conatains the explanation for various objects which are used in the run_analysis.R file created as part of the Getting and Cleaning data Course Project


features_data  <- A data frame which contains column names for observations in the files x_train.txt and x_text.txt
activity_labels <-  A data frame which contains varrious descriptive labels for various activities
words and colsToKeep <- Charactrer vectors which are used internally to select only the mean and std columns

subject_train <- A data frame which contains the data from subject_train dataset
x_train <- A data frame which contains the data from x_train dataset
x_finaltrain <- A dataframe which is a subset of x_train dataset with columns related to mean and std and also has column names added
y_train <- A dataframe which contains data from y_train dataset

train_data <- A dataframe generated by using cbind(subject_train,y_train,x_finaltrain)

subject_test <- A data frame which contains the data from subject_test dataset
x_test <- A data frame which contains the data from x_test dataset
x_test <- A dataframe which is a subset of x_test dataset with columns related to mean and std and also has column names added
y_test <- A dataframe which contains data from y_test dataset

test_data <- A dataframe generated by using cbind(subject_test,y_test,x_finaltest)

merged_data <- A dataframe generated by combining data from train_data and test data

Once the data is read we assign discriptive values to the Activities in the merged data as per the project requirement using the values from activity_lables dataset

We then apply the ddply function from the plyr package to caluculate the mean for each column grouped by the subject and the activity label

The tidy_data is the written to the file tidy_data.txt using the write.table function
